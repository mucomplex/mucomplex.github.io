description: Handling payload or data for exploit development.

On this topic, I will teach simple python trick to handle payload or data during exploit development.Most common mistake new exploit developer is data handling,for example type conversion,padding, raise exception and etc. <br>

<b> Payload Splitting </b> <br>
This useful when you need to cut payload to get some informational value,eg: ip address and port , stack cookie, rbp (base pointer) , return address <br><br>

<b> Unpack data </b> <br>
During receive packet request (<b> process.recv(1024) </b>) , data need to be unpack first for logical use.(eg:xor,add,sub,div and etc). without this, you will be headache to handle type conversion and even implement some of beginner new algorithm to handle this kind of data.<br><br>

<b> Logical process </b> <br><br>

<b> Encoder </b> <br>
You can't simply use function <b>hex()</b>,Exception raise will be <b>hex() argument can't be converted to hex</b>.you need to use proper calling encoding function for string. <br><br>

<b> Pack data </b> <br>
Once you ready to send your data/payload . It should be packed the data/payload first. <br><br>

<b> length adjust </b> <br>
Sometimes, packet that you receive is short that expected value.for example packet receive after leak some information is 6 byte, 2 byte short.Usually short byte is null byte,Carriage Return (CR) or Line Feed(LF).It's proper for you to implement padding on your data/packet. <br><br>

<b> Encode and decode looping logic </b> <br>
You can simply manipulate each byte of your payload by looping logic. <br><br>

<b> Brute force logic </b><br><br>
