Hi guys, today I will show some trick to bypass _Space_ if you allowed to execute command injection.This trick really useful when you want to invade the target machine<br>
first trick is by curly braces the command and argument. eg: {command,arg1,arg2,..} <br><br>
The output will result as image 1 <br><br>

second trick is define _${IFS}_ which mean "internal field separator" <br><br>

third trick is adding quote "'" between alphabet of parameter.You also can add it on command.<br><br>
